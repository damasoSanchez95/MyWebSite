                        I'm Dámaso Sánchez Arenas and I'm from Spain. More concretely from Toledo, where I was living when I was a child. 
                        There, I grew up with my family and my friends. In Toledo, I studied primary and secondary where I did the technological high school. <br> <br>

                        From a young age I have known that I wanted to study computer science 
                        because my father has an electrical appliances store and I have always been surrounded by the latest technologies. <br> <br>

                        When I was 18 I went to Madrid to study computer engineering at the Complutense University of Madrid (Algorithms itinerary). 
                        I have been studying the degree around for 6 years in which the last three years while I was studying I was working too.
                        It was a complicated stage because despite being young, I had to study and at the same time earn money to be able to live as I wanted. <br> <br>

                        At that stage, in addition to gaining a lot of technical knowledge, i gained a great sense of responsibility which helps me a lot of today. <br> <br>
                        
                        After that, I started to working mainly as Big Data Engineer and i gained a lot of interest in everything that related to the informatics and business world. 
                        Regarding development, i'm used to learning new lenguajes and tools quickly because i try to research and complete moocs on things that Its new for me.<br> <br>
                        If you want to know more about my experience and my knowledge, please visit the section where I show my <a class="link" href="./portfolio/index_portfolio.html">Portfolio</a>. <br> <br>

                        Personally, I consider myself as an ambitous person, honesty and very friendly. In the work i try to be a good team player and give my maximum.

                        And ... This is me :). I hope you liked my description and if you need any help or aske something, please <a class="link" href="#contacto">Contact</a> me.<br> <br>
